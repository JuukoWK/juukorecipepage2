# Recipe Project *WK Juuko*

Ingredients
3 cups all-purpose flour, divided
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 tablespoon olive oil, melted unsalted butter, or ghee
1 cup warm water (between 110 and 115 F)
Steps to Make It
Gather ingredients.

Mix the flour and salt together in a large bowl.

Add the oil (or butter or ghee), and pour in the warm water. Mix well to form a dough.

Transfer dough to a clean surface, and knead for about 10 minutes. Form dough into a ball, wrap with plastic wrap, and set it aside to rest for about 1 hour.

After resting, divide the dough into 6 equally sized balls. Using a rolling pin, roll each ball out, on a floured surface, to about an 8-inch diameter.

Heat a cast iron pan or another dry griddle over medium high heat. Cook each chapati, one at a time, until browned and puffed, about 1 minute per side. Pressing lightly around the edges with a spatula will help air bubbles form.

Serve immediately.
