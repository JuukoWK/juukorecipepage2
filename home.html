                <p>Chapati is an unleavened flatbread which is believed to have its origin from India. Though many other theories are suggesting that its origin is from East Africa, some believe itâ€™s from Persia. However, what we are sure about is that the relationship between early travelers and traders made this flatbread popular and even a staple in other regions like Nepal, Carribean Bangladesh Sri Lanka, and Pakistan.</p>

            <li>Gather Ingredients</li>
            
           <li>Mix the flour and salt together in a large bowl.</li> 
            
           <li>Add the oil (or butter or ghee), and pour in the warm water. Mix well to form a dough.</li> 
            
           <li>Transfer dough to a clean surface, and knead for about 10 minutes. Form dough into a ball, wrap with plastic wrap, and set it aside to rest for about 1 hour.</li> 
            
           <li>After resting, divide the dough into 6 equally sized balls. Using a rolling pin, roll each ball out, on a floured surface, to about an 8-inch diameter.</li> 
            
           <li>Heat a cast iron pan or another dry griddle over medium high heat. Cook each chapati, one at a time, until browned and puffed, about 1 minute per side. Pressing lightly around the edges with a spatula will help air bubbles form.</li> 
            
            <li>Serve immediately.</li>
